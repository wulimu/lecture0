    <h1>INTRODUCTION</h1>
    <p>Flood has been accompanying human history since the beginning of civilization. It is one of the most devesdating disasters that disturbs people's life in the ancient days and nowadays alike. Coinsidently or not, different civilizations have recorded historical floods in the pre-modern world in their own records. Perhaps the Great Flood in the Bible is the most influential event of all human history worldwide. For anyone who has read the story, it is beyond our understanding that that Great Flood had wiped all humans on the surface of the earth except Noah and his family. Thousands miles from the Tigeris River, in the vast land of East Asia, the legend of an anceint flood and Chinese ancestor's perseverant effort to harness the water has been passsed down generations by generations. People still praises those government officials who work so hard on their job that they don't even walk into their own houses while passing by three times. However, today we know that the occurence of a flood event is caused by excessive rainfall and runoff. The basics of rainfall and runoff form one of the basci science topic - <a href="hydrology.html">Hydrology</a>. Though hydrology sounds very natual, human acticity has played a big role in some local flash flood worldwide, especialy when a landslide and flood cohappens. In many developing countries, flash flood occurs in the rural area due to overgraze and unregulated timber industry. Where trees and pastures were destroyed at a quick speed, the majority of the rainfall turned into surface runoff since there's no green plants to hold any water. Then the runoff in turns drains rapidly into gutters, ditchs, streams, and finally rivers. When the runoff exceeds the capacity of the river, it overflows the banks and into properties, causing damage. These phenomenum has been well studied by hydrologist, hydrogeologist and civil engineers. Another form of flood happens in urban areas where the municipal drainage system fail to accomdate the runoff when rainfall events exceed a certain return period. Though detention pond, underground drainage systems, roadside ditches are seen in cities, they don't always function fully. Ditches can be clogged after years of debris piling. Driange inlets can be blocked by dirt and neglected yard grass. If the downstream area has been raining for long, another storm in the upper stream can cause water to back up since the new runoff has nowhere to go. The infamous 2016 Flood in Louisian has met such conditions. Today it is a common practice for municipals to put a drainage impact study (DIS) in their ordinance. Engineering firms are required by submit DIS to city or parish review engineers to ensure that the impact of the new development has met the ordinance. However, with more human activity filling natural wetlands and water courses, flood will never disapper in our life. The only difference is time, scale, and location.
