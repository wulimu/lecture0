    <h1>INTRODUCTION <div class="">  </div>   </h1>
    <p>Flood has been accompanying human history since the beginning of civilization. It is one of the most devesdating disasters that disturbs people's life in the ancient days and nowadays alike. Coincidently or not, different civilizations have recorded historical floods in the pre-modern world in their own records. Perhaps the <span class="biblical">Great Flood</span> in the Bible is the most influential event of all human history worldwide. For anyone who has read the story, it is beyond our understanding that the <span class="biblical">Great Flood</span> had wiped all humans on the earth surface except <span class="biblical">Noah</span> and his family. To make it even more inconceivable, the Bible clearly recorded that water were coming down from above and up from the ground, which might sound strange to an ordinary person. Meanwhile, thousands miles away from the Tigeris River, in the vast land of East Asia, a legend of an anceint flood and Chinese ancestors' perseverant effort to harness the overwhelming water also spreded out. It have been passsed down generations after generations and even today people praise those government officials who model the ancient hero who was so dedicated to solve the taunting flood threat that three times he didn't walk into his own house while passing by. But, in the Chinese legend what caused the flood was very different from the Bible. The Chinese ancestors believed the water fell off the sky from a huge hole, but never mentioned water from under ground. Today, any student who studies earth science, environmental engineering or civil engineering will tell you water can come from both above and below. We also know that the occurence of a flood event is caused by excessive rainfall and runoff. The basics of rainfall and runoff form one of the basic science topic -
    <a href="hydrology.html"><span class="academterm">Hydrology</span></a>. Though hydrology sounds very natual, human acticity has played a big role in some local flash flood events, especialy when a landslide and flood cohappens. In many developing countries, flash flood occurs in the rural area due to overgraze and unregulated timber industry. Where trees and pastures were destroyed at a quick speed, the majority of the rainfall turned into surface runoff since there's no green plants to hold any water. Then the runoff in turns drains rapidly into gutters, ditchs, streams, and finally rivers. When the runoff exceeds the capacity of the river, it overflows the banks and into properties, causing damage. These phenomenum has been well studied by hydrologist, hydrogeologist and civil engineers. Another form of flood happens in urban areas where the municipal drainage system fail to accomdate the runoff when rainfall events exceed a certain return period. Though detention pond, underground drainage systems, roadside ditches are seen in cities, they don't always function fully. Ditches can be clogged after years of debris piling. Driange inlets can be blocked by dirt and neglected yard grass. If the downstream area has been raining for long, another storm in the upper stream can cause water to back up since the new runoff has nowhere to go. The infamous 2016 Flood in Louisian has met such conditions. Today it is a common practice for municipals to put a drainage impact study (<a href="#DIS"><span id="acronym">DIS</span></a>) in their ordinance. Engineering firms are required to submit
    <a href="#DIS"><span id="acronym">DIS</span></a> to city or parish review engineers to ensure that the impact of the new development has met the ordinance. However, with more human activity filling natural wetlands and water courses, flood will never disapper in our life. The only question would be when, where and how big.

    <h2>Flood Routing</h2>
    <p>According to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Routing_(hydrology)">Wikipedia</a>, "Flood routing is a procedure to determine the time and magnitude of flow (i.e., the flow hydrograph) at a point on a watercourse from known or assumed hydrographs at one or more points upstream. The procedure is specifically known as Flood routing, if the flow is a flood." Chow and Maidment clearly used this concept in their classic book "Applied Hydrology" (published in 1998), which has been a standard for many years in college level hydrology courses. </p>
    <p>The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Routing_(hydrology)">Wikipedia</a> further explains that "In order to determine the change in shape of a hydrograph of a flood as it travels through a natural river or artificial channel, different flood simulation techniques can be used. Traditionally, the hydraulic (e.g. dynamic and diffusion wave models) and hydrologic (e.g. linear and nonlinear Muskingum models) routing procedures that are well known as distributed and lumped ways to hydraulic and hydrologic practitioners, respectively, can be utilized. The hydrologic models need to estimate hydrologic parameters using recorded data in both upstream and downstream sections of rivers and/or by applying robust optimization techniques to solve the one-dimensional conservation of mass and storage-continuity equation. On the other hand, hydraulic models require the gathering of a lot of data related to river geometry and morphology and consume a lot of computer resources in order to solve the equations numerically. However, semi-distributed models such as Muskingumâ€“Cunge family procedures are also available. Simple physical concepts and common river characteristic consisting of channel geometry, reach length, roughness coefficient, and slope are used to estimate the model parameters without complex and expensive numerical solutions. In general, based on the available field data and goals of a project, one of these approaches is utilized for the simulation of flooding in rivers and channels."  </p>

    <h2>Urban Storm Drainage Development</h2>
    <p>The best way to discuss urban storm drainge might be introducing the book "<span class="academterm">Urban Stormwater Management in the United States</span>". This is one authoritative refernece published by the National Academies Press (NAP) to address the topic. It is availlable for free download on their website: <a href="https://doi.org/10.17226/12465">https://doi.org/10.17226/12465</a>. The introduction of the book says "The rapid conversion of land to urban and suburban areas has profoundly altered how water flows during and following storm events, putting higher volumes of water and more pollutants into the nation's rivers, lakes, and estuaries. These changes have degraded water quality and habitat in virtually every urban stream system. The Clean Water Act regulatory framework for addressing sewage and industrial wastes is not well suited to the more difficult problem of stormwater discharges.
    This book calls for an entirely new permitting structure that would put authority and accountability for stormwater discharges at the municipal level. A number of additional actions, such as conserving natural areas, reducing hard surface cover (e.g., roads and parking lots), and retrofitting urban areas with features that hold and treat stormwater, are recommended." </p>

    <h1>Flood Insurance & FEMA <div class="">  </div>   </h1>
    <h2>Flood Insurance development</h2>
    <h2>Federal Emergency Management Agency - FEMA</h2>
    <p>For 38 years, FEMA's mission remains: to lead America to prepare for, prevent, respond to and recover from disasters with a vision of "A Nation Prepared."

On April 1, 1979, President Jimmy Carter signed the executive order that created the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA).  From day one, FEMA has remained committed to protecting and serving the American people. That commitment to the people we serve and the belief in our survivor centric mission will never change.

The Federal Emergency Management Agency coordinates the federal government's role in preparing for, preventing, mitigating the effects of, responding to, and recovering from all domestic disasters, whether natural or man-made, including acts of terror.

FEMA can trace its beginnings to the Congressional Act of 1803. This act, generally considered the first piece of disaster legislation, provided assistance to a New Hampshire town following an extensive fire.

In the century that followed, ad hoc legislation was passed more than 100 times in response to hurricanes, earthquakes, floods and other natural disasters.</p>
<p>In March 2003, FEMA joined 22 other federal agencies, programs and offices in becoming the Department of Homeland Security.

The new department, headed by Secretary Tom Ridge, brought a coordinated approach to national security from emergencies and disasters - both natural and man-made.

On October 4, 2006, President George W. Bush signed into law the Post-Katrina Emergency Reform Act. The act significantly reorganized FEMA, provided it substantial new authority to remedy gaps that became apparent in the response to Hurricane Katrina in August 2005, the most devastating natural disaster in U.S. history, and included a more robust preparedness mission for FEMA.</p>
